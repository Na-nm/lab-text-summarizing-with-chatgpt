    "The summarization process successfully captured key details about the products, shipping, and price-value aspects. However, there were some variations that didn’t work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The model effectively summarized product features and key aspects concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It extracted relevant shipping details when available but correctly noted when such information was missing.\n",

    "    - The price and value-focused summaries provided a clear assessment of whether the product was worth the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Issues & Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - No major hallucinations were observed, but minor rewording could slightly shift emphasis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The model sometimes excluded secondary but useful details, such as additional product features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If shipping wasn’t mentioned in a review, the model handled it correctly instead of fabricating details.\n",

    "- Key Learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - GPT performs well with structured prompts, ensuring focused summarization.\n",
    "\n",
